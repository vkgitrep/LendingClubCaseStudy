## Problem Statement

### Introduction
In this case study, we apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services. We aim to understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

### Business Understanding
We work for a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it must make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant's profile.

Two types of risks are associated with the bank's decision:

1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., likely to default, approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The provided data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they 'defaulted' or not. The goal is to identify patterns indicating if a person is likely to default, which can be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or lending to risky applicants at a higher interest rate.
